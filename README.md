# Computer Graphics Booting Up

## Let's start with ModernGL

This lab stands to prepare the moderngl development environment. Below the steps and requirements for initial coding tasks. Please make sure to edit the python provided files; for dependencies, you can add the files you need.

1. Install moderngl and its dependencies
2. Make sure that the following programs run
    - [`01_hello_world.py`](./01_hello_world.py)
    - [`06_multiple_objects.py`](./06_multiple_objects.py)
    - [`09_models_and_images.py`](./09_models_and_images.py)
        - _Modify this program to change the box's texture to a correctly aligned TEC logo_
3. Document how to execute the 3 programs in the section below.

* For documentation and missing dependencies, follow these links:
    - https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl
    - https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/

## How to run your program

```
#Program 1: Install the next dependencies
- pip install moderngl 
- pip install moderngl[headless]
- pip install moderngl-window

#Program 2: Install the next dependencies
- pip install numpy
- pip install pyglm

#Program 3: Install the next dependencies
- pip install objloader
- pip install pillow

Change the following lines of the code according to the name and the path of your images (Tec Logo)
Line 109: put your image path, for instance: self.texture = ImageTexture('itesm.jpg')
Line 111: put your image path, for instance: self.car_geometry = ModelGeometry('lowpoly_toy_car.obj')
Line 114: put your image path,  self.crate_geometry = ModelGeometry('crate.obj')

And that is it! You should be able to run the three codes without problems
```

## Grading Policy

- 25% - `01_hello_world.py` is running with no errors
- 25% - `06_multiple_objects.py` is running with no errors
- 25% - `09_models_and_images.py` is running with the requested change (TEC logo texture)
- 25% - Documentation on how to run your programs
